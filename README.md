# RealMadridCFResourcesPod
App customization using frameworks developed with Swift 3.0, XCode 8.1, Podspec and Cocoapods

The aim of this project is to be able to customize each target of this project with different external resources 
(Audios, Autoresizing properties, Dimensions, Fonts, Images, Json, Positions, Swift classes and Videos). In this
way we have a unique source code with different look & feel depends on its compiled target.

These resources are importing to the project as a Pod with CocoaPods from a Pod library hosted in Github:
- bgonzalezjurado/RealMadridCFResourcesPod
- bgonzalezjurado/FCBarcelonaResourcesPod
